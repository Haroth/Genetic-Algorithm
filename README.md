# Genetic Algorithm

## General info

This project contains implementation of Genetic Algorithm for QAP problems. It is written in C++ and it contains about 700 lines of code. QAP problem is NP-hard and it is one of the most difficult problems in optimization theory. In this case, the genetic algorithm is one of the best methods of searching for solutions. That type of problems requires special type of crossover and mutation methods. This software provides three types of crossover. The innovation of the project was dynamic change of the mutation parameter. This change has been improved overall performance of the algorithm.
